1. Function Execution Context
2. Global Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context (used in Mongoose)

The Global EC of a browser is different from that of Node environment

*****************************************************************************************

A Javascript code block {} runs in TWO phases:

1. Memory Creation Phase (Memory Phase) / Creation Phase :
                
                In this phase whatever variables etc. we have declared, memory gets assigned
                to them. No execution steps takes place in this step.

2. Execution Phase





****************************** GLOBAL EXECUTION / GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT ************************************

=> Any code no matter how big or small it runs via Global Execution
=> It is allocated via THIS.
=> This is the very first step.


******************************* MEMORY CREATION PHASE ******************************************************

=> All variables are collected and kept in the memory.
=> This is the second step.


For this we will take an example of a code block

**************************************
let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
function addNum(num1, num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
}
let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addNum(10, 2)
***************************************

=> val1 = undefined
=> val2 = undefined
=> addNum = Definition of the funtion (Decides what operation has to take place)
=> result1 = undefined
=> result2 = undefined


******************************************************* Execution Phase *******************************************

=> This is the step where the executiont takes place and this is the third phase

=> The execution phase will be concerned only with this part of the code

=> result1 = undefined
=> result2 = undefined

=> Everytime a function is executed a new box is created called NEW EXECUTIONAL CONTEXT

=> A sandbox is created for both New Variable Env and Execution Thread

=> So every time a function is called a sandbox is created for both Memory Phase and Execution Phase
