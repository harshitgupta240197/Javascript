// ABSTRACTION
/**Abstraction in JavaScript is a core principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves 
 hiding the complex implementation details of an object and showing only the essential features or 
 functionality to the user. This simplifies code usage, improves maintainability, and increases security.  */
