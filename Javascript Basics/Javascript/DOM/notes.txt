WEB ELEMENT MANIPULATION

Web element manipulation involves using code (primarily JavaScript with the DOM) or tools (like Selenium) to dynamically select, 
change, add, or remove content, styles, and structure (attributes, text, HTML) of elements in a webpage, making sites interactive, 
creating dynamic content, and automating tasks like form filling or testing. 
Key methods include finding elements by ID/class/tag (e.g., getElementById), changing properties (innerHTML, src), 
manipulating attributes (setAttribute), and responding to user actions with event listeners (e.g., onclick). 


WINDOW consists of :

1. DOM - Document Object Models
        -> Element
2. BOM - Browser Object Model
        -> Screen
        -> Navigator
        -> Location
3. JavaScript
        -> objects
        -> Array
        -> Function
        -> Class

Document Object Model (DOM): 
A tree-like representation of the HTML document, allowing scripts to access and modify its structure, style, and content.

The Browser Object Model (BOM):
In JavaScript this is a collection of objects that allows JavaScript to interact with the web browser and its environment, 
beyond the content of the web page itself. The top-level object in the BOM hierarchy is the window object, which contains 
all other BOM objects.
